        | The themes for these sites were developed by myself and based on the Sage theme framework.
        | I have also developed over a dozen small-to-medium sized plugins to enhance various aspects of the main library website.
        | The code for some of these is available in my github repository, but they have not been publicly released as official WordPress plugins.
