        | I'm Alex Ciarlillo and I'm a <em>just</em> a developer. 
        | I have a passion for all things computing - from the Linux kernel to the latest JS frameworks and everything in between. 
        | I graduated in 2008 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ohio University and since then I have been working for the University library developing various WordPress based web sites and web based applications for patrons and library staff.

        | I have been using computers since roughly Windows 3.1 (1992), and built my first computer (Pentium II 500) in 1999. I began my first forays into programming at the age of 15 with an old copy of Borland C++ 5.0, and quickly moved into Java, later followed by interpreted lanuages such as Ruby and Python.
        | Computing has been the cornerstone of my life for as long as I can remember, and my wide breadth of knowledge has helped me to quickly learn and adapt to new languages, concepts, and design patterns. Although my current focus is web development, I feel comfortable approaching almost any problem with the proper tools to solve it, whatever they may be.

        | My hobbies are primarily kayak fishing, casual PC gaming and personal home automation projects.
